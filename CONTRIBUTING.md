# Contributing to koa-router-multer

Contributions to this minimalist library are welcome;

## Roadmap

### Keep up
The roadmap really just consists of trying to keep in sync with [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer).
This is what this library is built upon. 

### Unit tests
Unit tests are not covering 100% of the functionnalities, more coverage is welcome to ensure consistent behaviour of the lib across releases.

### Backward compatible
[Koa](http://koajs.com/) is in active development, many apps are still using the initial v1 version. This library attempts to keep backward compatibility with v1 while suppporting v2 as well.
Changes shall ensure the lib works across the two versions, until v1 becomes obsolete.

## PR
To contribute, simply raise an issue. Fork this repo, make your change and submit a PR.
Changes will be reviewed and merged. A new release can be published on demand.
